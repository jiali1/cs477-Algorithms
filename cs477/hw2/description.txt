Implemention of a modified bubble sort that alternates left-to-right and right-to-left
passes through the data. For example, if sorting the array [6, 5, 2, 8, 3, 1], the first
left-to-right pass will swap elements that are out of order and get the result: [5, 2, 6, 3, 1,
8]. The right-to-left pass begins at element 1 (on position 5) and goes all the way to the
beginning of the array. At the end of this pass we have [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 8]. The next phase 
works only on the segment [5, 2, 6, 3] as elements 1 and 8 have already been placed at
their final location.
The algorithm will sort the following array: “EASYQUESTION”. It will also print the status
of the array at the end of each left-to-right and right-to-left pass.
